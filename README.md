so i opened control panel and opened windows defender firewall then clicked on advance settings and saw a lot of rules ,then i started to create my own rule to Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23(telnet) , i right clicked on inbound rules then selected new rule and then entered port 23 and selected block the connection and named it block telnet.

so firewall basically  uses rules to determine whether to allow or block incoming or outgoing network packets , inbound control traffic coming  to system and outbound control traffic going out from system
